# iTermSplitPane

- This script helps you create a iTerm2 Window with four split panes.
- You can customize what you want the split panes to do via profiles.
- In my case, profiles pe1, pe2, pe3 and pe4 automatically log me into these devices.
- For the profile to automatically run a command, simply select the Command mode as "Login Shell" and input the command you'd like to run on profile startup. In my case it is `ssh admin@192.168.56.20` which logs me into my device. See screenshot below:

- Similarly assign login shell commands for other profiles as well.
